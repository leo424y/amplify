The reader must participate.  At every stage, he/she must decide whether or not the idea being presented is clear.  Ask yourself these questions:

Why is this idea true?

Do I really believe it?

Could I convince someone else that it is true?

Why didn't the author use a different argument?

Do I have a better argument or method of explaining the idea?

Why didn't the author explain it the way that I understand it?

Is my way wrong?

Do I really get the idea?

Am I missing some subtlety?

Did this author miss a subtlety?

If I can't understand the point, perhaps I can understand a similar but simpler idea?

Which simpler idea?

Is it really necessary to understand this idea?

Can I accept this point without understanding the details of why it is true?

Will my understanding of the whole story suffer from not understanding why the point is true?
