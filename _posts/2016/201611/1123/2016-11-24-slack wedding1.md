Even the most simple of weddings between two loving people can become an unwieldy hydra of stress and trauma.

The best way to handle this is through open communication and agreeable boundaries, but that can be a challenge when your mother-in-law is threatening to wear leopard print and no one can find the best man.

Slack, a messaging app that aims to end email, functions as a multi-level messaging service where users can share, collaborate and communicate. Users can employ it for simple communication or "hack" the app to handle more complex projects, like a wedding. And push notification settings can be a dream when you're running around town with only a smartphone.

Here are 13 ways you can use Slack to take some of the stress out of your big day. (But you are on your own with the in-laws.)


1. Photo sharing

The most fun pictures of your big day are those you may never see (or the ones you might not want the whole world to see). Slack users (in this case, wedding guests) can easily drag and drop photos and videos into the app where everyone can share and download. Since you invite users to your Slack group, there is an extra level of privacy, so not everyone on Facebook will see your maid of honor swinging a bra over her head.


2. Checklists

Asking for help is your biggest boon in planning a wedding. Slack has to-do list integration ‚Äî you can assign tasks and create your own lists. You can also create lists within channels. Consider a channel for #groomsmen and add a list just for them.

3. Calendar collaboration

Slack integrates with Google Calendar, allowing you to share a schedule of events, coordinate the bachelorette party and log travel info.

4. Plan activities

Create a channel for out-of-town guests where they can plan activities during their free time.

5. Invite lists

You don‚Äôt have to call your mom for Uncle Steve‚Äôs address or call Uncle Steve for your cousin‚Äôs address. Create a spreadsheet in Google Drive and share the link on Slack so your family can collaborate and update the document.

Guest lists are the worst. Why can't I just invite everyone I've ever known?? #ohyeah #money #weddingfun #orsomething

6. Reminders

It‚Äôs easy to forget things right before your wedding. You can use Slack to send you reminders, so you don‚Äôt forget a thing.

7. DJ requests

Create a channel where guests can make suggestions for the DJ or collaborate on the ultimate party playlist.

8. Track contracts

Uploading documents in Slack is easy. Add your vendor contracts to a special channel or private group, for easy access. That way you have them on hand, should the bakery forget to deliver your cake. It happens.

9. Ride sharing

Create a special channel for guests so they can coordinate rides to and from the airport or even share hotel rooms.

10. Hashtag tracking

Slack also integrates with Facebook and Instagram so you can keep track of all the selfies people are taking with your grandma.

11. Last-minute emergencies

No matter how well you plan, there is always some emergency, whether your brother stains his tux or the band forgets an extension cord. When it does, you can use Slack to send out a tux SOS or have someone pick up supplies. And better yet, people can collaborate to solve the problem without you.

12. Private groups

Slack also has the ability to create private groups so you can make one for bridesmaids or groomsmen, your family or his family. This is important because not everyone needs to know everything.

13. Divert communication

With Slack‚Äôs private groups and open channels, guests can communicate directly with each other or your wedding planner. This way you don‚Äôt have to field 100 text messages from your aunt asking you for the millionth time where pictures are going to be.
