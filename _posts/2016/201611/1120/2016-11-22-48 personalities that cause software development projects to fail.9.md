* [The Scope Wiggler](https://neilonsoftware.com/books/personality-patterns-of-problematic-projects/product-managers/the-scope-wiggler/) – A Product Manager who bypasses change control and impact analysis by presenting a big requirements change as a series of small changes distributed over time.
* [The Patent Author](https://neilonsoftware.com/books/personality-patterns-of-problematic-projects/product-managers/the-patent-author/) – A Product Manager who produces such a high volume of requirements documentation that it creates a barrier to adapting to change, as the documentation must be kept up to date.
* [The Napkin Sketcher](https://neilonsoftware.com/books/personality-patterns-of-problematic-projects/product-managers/the-napkin-sketcher/) – A Product Manager whose requirements are so vague that the development team must fill in the gaps, only to be told their decisions were incorrect.
* [The Executive Assistant](https://neilonsoftware.com/books/personality-patterns-of-problematic-projects/product-managers/the-executive-assistant/) – A Product Manager who only documents what the stakeholders have asked for, but denies access to the stakeholders, such that requirements cannot be negotiated.
* [The Sales Liaison](https://neilonsoftware.com/books/personality-patterns-of-problematic-projects/product-managers/the-sales-liaison/) – A Product Manager who is only concerned with meeting the demands of the sales team, giving no thought to a holistic product vision.
* [The Dictator](https://neilonsoftware.com/books/personality-patterns-of-problematic-projects/product-managers/the-dictator/) – A Product Manager that rejects any idea that did not come from them.
* [The Scope Creeper](https://neilonsoftware.com/books/personality-patterns-of-problematic-projects/product-managers/the-scope-creeper/) – A Product Manager who increases the scope of a project while keeping the delivery date the same.
