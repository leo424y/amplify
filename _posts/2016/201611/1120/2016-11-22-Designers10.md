### [Designers](https://neilonsoftware.com/books/personality-patterns-of-problematic-projects/designers/)

* [The Note Taker](https://neilonsoftware.com/books/personality-patterns-of-problematic-projects/designers/the-note-taker/) – A Designer who is relegated to doing nothing more than documenting the ideas of others.
* [The Disenfranchised](https://neilonsoftware.com/books/personality-patterns-of-problematic-projects/designers/the-disenfranchised/) – A Designer who feels they are powerless to influence the design of the project, and therefore are not providing design direction.
* [The Artist](https://neilonsoftware.com/books/personality-patterns-of-problematic-projects/designers/the-artist/) – A Designer who is more concerned with how the product looks and feels than if it does anything useful for the end user.
* [The Professor](https://neilonsoftware.com/books/personality-patterns-of-problematic-projects/designers/the-professor/) – A Designer so committed to the science and theory of user interface design, that they ignore the UI requirements coming from the stakeholders.
* [The Distrusted](https://neilonsoftware.com/books/personality-patterns-of-problematic-projects/designers/the-distrusted/) – A Designer who has lost all credibility with the project team, leading to their UI requirements being ignored as they are deemed to be not in the products’ best interest.
* [The Blueprinter](https://neilonsoftware.com/books/personality-patterns-of-problematic-projects/designers/the-blueprinter/) – A Designer who specifies every detail of the UI to such a fine level of specification that there is no leeway for developers to choose alternative implementations that can reduce development time.
