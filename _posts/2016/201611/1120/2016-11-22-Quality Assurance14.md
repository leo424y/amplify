* [The Scientist](https://neilonsoftware.com/books/personality-patterns-of-problematic-projects/quality-assurance/the-scientist/) – A QA who spends the majority of time documenting bugs, rather than finding new bugs.
* [The Misleader](https://neilonsoftware.com/books/personality-patterns-of-problematic-projects/quality-assurance/the-misleader/) – A QA who often reports bugs inaccurately, leading the developer down the wrong path as they attempt to reproduce and fix the problem.
