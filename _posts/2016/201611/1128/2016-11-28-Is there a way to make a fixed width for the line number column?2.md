I'd ike to set the width of the line number column to have a fixed width. For example, It'd be nice to have room for say, 4 digits. That way when you go from line 9 to line 10 the whole page doesn't have to shift to the right to make room for two digits.

There was another post about this but there wasn't an answer. I'm new to atom and haven't made any changes to the styles.less file.
