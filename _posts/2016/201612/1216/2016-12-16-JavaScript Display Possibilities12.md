JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().


The document.write() method should only be used for testing.
To "display data" in HTML, (in most cases) you will set the value of an innerHTML property.
